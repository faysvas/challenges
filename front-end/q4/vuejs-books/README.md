# vuejs-books

## Project setup

npm install

npm start

### Compiles and minifies for production

With the **book server** and **project server** still running, you can run some tests.

I used **Cypress** for **E2E** tests. You can start them up with

```bash
npm run e2e-tests
```

and you can run some **Jest** **Unit** tests in the console with

```bash
npm run unit-tests
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
